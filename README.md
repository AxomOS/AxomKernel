# Looking for maintainers
We are looking for maintainers to help with Axom as currently this is a solo project and I honestly couldn't do this by myself.
If you would like to help, please DM me on Discord, my username is sfulham#0001.

# AxomKernel
AxomKernel is a new kernel written in C/C++ and assembly.

# Contributing
